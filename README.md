# Bsky to FxBsky Extension

This Chrome extension simplifies the process of converting a Bluesky link (`bsky.app`) to its corresponding `fxbsky.app` format and copying it to the clipboard.

## How it Works

The extension adds a button to your Chrome toolbar. When you're on a Bluesky page and click the button, it automatically:

1.  Fetches the current page's URL.
2.  Replaces `bsky.app` with `fxbsky.app` in the URL.
3.  Copies the modified URL to your clipboard.

## Installation for Development

1.  Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4.  Click "Load unpacked" and select the   
 directory where you cloned/downloaded this repository.   


The extension will now be installed and a button will appear in your toolbar.

2.  Click the extension's button in your toolbar.
3.  The modified `fxbsky.app` link will be copied to your clipboard.
